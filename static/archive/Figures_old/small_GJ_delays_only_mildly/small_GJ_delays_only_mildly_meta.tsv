Synchrony index (a), firing rate (b), and network frequency (c) as functions of the GJ connection probability pGJ and the GJ delay dGJ. The gray squares denote the standard parameters. Bottom row, Example traces at pGJ fixed to 0, 0.06, and 0.12, as denoted by gray lines in the graphs at the top. Standard GJ parameters are used, that is, <df> = 0.25 mV and <U+03B3> = 1.0 nS. (d<U+0096>f) Same network quantities as in (a<U+0096>c) for a uniformly distributed active-spike GJ component <df> (width of support: Delta <df>, mean value: <df> = 0.25 mV) and a uniformly distributed GJ delay dGJ (width of support: Delta GJ delay dGJ, mean: dGJ = 0.4 ms). Colorbars are identical to the ones in (a<U+0096>c), and gray bars above colorbars denote the range of values plotted in (d<U+0096>f), that is, 0.31<U+0096>0.38 for the synchrony index, 111<U+0096>119 spikes/s for the firing rates, and 156<U+0096>165 Hz for the network frequency, respectively.
