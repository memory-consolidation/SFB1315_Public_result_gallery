CaMPARI and Cal-Light expression and functionality in neuronal cell culture.<U+00A0>(A)<U+00A0>Wide-field epifluorescence images of neuronal cell culture expressing CaMPARI. Top row, pre-photoconversion images showing fluorescence exclusively in the green channel. Bottom row, post-photoconversion images showing mixed green and red fluorescence after ~5 min of total illumination with 395 nm light.<U+00A0>(B)<U+00A0>Wide-field epifluorescence images of neuronal cell culture expressing Cal-Light. Top row, pre-photoactivation images showing fluorescence in the red (tdTomato) channel. Bottom row, post-photoactivation images showing mixed red and green (GFP) fluorescence after ~8<U+0096>10 min of total illumination with 470 nm light and after 6 days of expression time. Scale bars, 200 <U+00B5>m and 50 <U+00B5>m in insets. Images were taken on a wide-field epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti2) using a 10x air objective (Plan Apo, 0.8 NA, 1,000 <U+00B5>m WD) and a Lumencor Spectra X LED. Fluorescence was imaged through 519/26 nm (GFP) and 642/80 nm (tdTomato) bandpass emission filters."
