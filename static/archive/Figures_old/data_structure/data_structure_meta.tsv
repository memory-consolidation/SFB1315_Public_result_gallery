The master project_metadata file was linking the address of the metadata files and the data folder. The experiment metadata file was linking to each data file (for clarity, only one folder was shown here). The format of the data was either .xlsx summary files (min or hour) or the HCS output files .mbr (behavior sequence) and .tbd (position), note that the software was not reading the .tbd files. By reading the master file, the computer could determine the path to every data file. Upon analysis, the software created a new folder indicating the software name and version. Its reports were saved there, while derived data files were saved in a folder named after the software name, but not its version."
