The CA1 neurons are coupled by gap junctions (GJs, orange) and inhibitory synapses (gray lines with circles at their ends). (b) More detailed scheme of connectivity. To resemble an in vitro slice preparation, the network is chosen to consist of 200 neurons (here only 20 shown). GJs are introduced with a connectivity of 0.3 between the 20% nearest neighbors, that is, 0.06 overall connectivity (curves, highlighted in orange for one neuron on the left). Interneurons are randomly connected with a probability of 0.2 by inhibitory synapses (gray lines; highlighted in dark gray for one neuron on the left). (c) Membrane potentials of a postsynaptic neuron show the response to a presynaptic action potential (top, black) when neurons are connected by only"	"https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14267"	"Published"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-05-16 16:28:02"	"Null"	"Null"
