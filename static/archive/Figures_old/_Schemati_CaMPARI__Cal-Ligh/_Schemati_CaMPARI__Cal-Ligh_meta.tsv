Schematic drawings of CaMPARI and Cal-Light.<U+00A0>(A)<U+00A0>CaMPARI, a calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator, is a circularly permuted fluorescent protein with calcium sensor domains that undergoes green-to-red photoconversion when exposed to ~400 nm light in the presence of high Ca2+. Adapted with permission from<U+00A0>Fosque et al. (2015).<U+00A0>(B)<U+00A0>Cal-Light activation. When Ca2+increases in the cytosol it triggers M13 and calmodulin to bind each other, allowing TEV-C and TEV-N to regain proteolytic functions. However, TEV protease cannot recognize TEVseq in a dark condition, because TEVseq is inserted at the C terminus of AsLOV2 Ja-helix. Blue light causes a conformational change in the Ja-helix, unmasking TEVseq. Cleaved tTA translocates to the nucleus and initiates gene expression. Adapted with permission from<U+00A0>Lee et al.
