Ripple oscillations are much stronger in an interneuronal network (N = 200) with GJs (left column; pGJ = 0.06) than in a network without GJs (right column; pGJ = 0). (a) Excitatory input to the interneuronal network. APs of the total excitatory population are shown in a rastergram, and average excitatory firing rates received by one interneuron (smoothed by a Gaussian filter with 1 ms width) are depicted in the plot above. Note that (a<U+0096>d) share a common time scale. (b) Same quantities as (a) but for the response of the interneuron network. (c) Membrane potentials of interneurons. Dark blue lines represent the population average, lighter blue lines correspond to individual neurons. (d) Spectrogram of the population activity showing elevated activity for the GJ network at 150<U+0096>200 Hz. (e) Power spectrum. For an overview of the parameters see Tables 1 and 2"	"https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14267"	"Published"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-05-16 16:28:02"	"Null"	"Null"
