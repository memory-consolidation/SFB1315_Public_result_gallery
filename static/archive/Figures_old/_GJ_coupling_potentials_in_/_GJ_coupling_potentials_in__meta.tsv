(a) Schematic of two GJ coupled PV+ BCs with simplified morphologies (model from Lee et al., 2014). AP (blue trace) in the left neuron (blue), and GJ coupling potential (red trace) in the right neuron (red). The position of the GJ is the same for both neurons. Thus, the distance that the AP has to travel from the soma to the GJ is the same as the distance the GJ coupling potential has to travel from the GJ to the soma. (b) Left, The maximal-rise (max.-rise) delay is calculated as the time between the maximal rise of the presynaptic AP (blue) and the maximal rise of the postsynaptic GJ potential (red). Potentials not to scale. Right, Max.-rise delays for APs of the two different models (Lee et al., 2014; Saudargiene et al., 2015). The displayed delays in (b) correspond to GJ coupling in the longer branches in the dendritic trees of the neurons in (a), and delays are qualitatively similar for the shorter branches. (b) and (c) share the same horizontal axis. (c), Same as (b) but for the amplitude of the GJ coupling potential. For an overview of the parameters see Tables 1 and 2"	"https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14267"	"Published"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-05-16 16:28:02"	"2018"	"Null"
