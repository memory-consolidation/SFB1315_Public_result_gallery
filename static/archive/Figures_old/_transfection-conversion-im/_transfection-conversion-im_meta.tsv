Procedure for transfection, conversion and imaging.<U+00A0>(A)<U+00A0>In this schematic, cultured neurons are treated with Cal-Light virus. After expression of the construct (indicated via red fluorescence), photostimulation is applied. Imaging then reveals neurons that were active while receiving the light stimulus (i.e., they co-express GFP and thus appear yellow in merged channels).<U+00A0>(B)<U+00A0>In this example, CaMPARI virus was injected into S1 cortex; expression of the construct is imaged using an epifluorescence microscope. A large number of neurons express CaMPARI 3 weeks after virus injection. Left, injection site imaged through the cranial window before and after 405 nm photoconversion. Note the reduction of green/red ratio immediately after photoconversion. Right, demonstration of photoconverted neurons in acute brain slices of S1 (parasagittal, 300 <U+00B5>m)."
