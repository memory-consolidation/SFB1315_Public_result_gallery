(a) Rastergrams show the activities of networks without GJs (pGJ = 0, top), with standard GJ connectivity (pGJ = 0.06, middle), and with strong GJ connectivity (pGJ = 0.12, bottom). Neurons receive Poisson input with a constant mean (4,000 spikes/s). GJ parameters are <df> = 0.25 mV and <U+03B3> = 1.0 nS. (b) The relative change of the synchrony index, the average firing rate, and the network frequency is depicted for different values of the GJ connection probability pGJ. Quantities are normalized by their respective values at pGJ = 0.06. GJ parameters as in (a). (c<U+0096>e) GJs parameters <df> and <U+03B3> contribute differentially to the network dynamics for fixed pGJ = 0.06. (c) Synchrony index as function of <df> and <U+03B3>. (d) Firing rate. (e) Network frequency. Gray squares denote the GJ standard parameters as used in (a) and (b). (f) and (g) The synchrony index is increased by GJs, and this increase is larger than what could be achieved by increasing the inhibitory connection probability (f) or the inhibitory peak conductance (g).
