The red line represents the accuracy when the real groups are used, while the distribution represent the accuracy obtained when data group membership was randomised previous to the analysis. Graphs are grouped via the number of time windows used in columns (1, 5 or all 6 windows, see text), categorisation of the behaviour (3 first rows Jhuang categoristation, 3 last rows Berlin categorisation) and the machine learning algorithm (L1 regularise regression: row 1 and 4, support vector machine with radial kernel: row 2 and 5,support vector machine with linear kernel: row 3 and 6.) P-values were obtained via a confidence intervals for binomial probabilities analysis."	"Null"	"preprint"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-05-16 16:27:21"	"Null"	"Null"
