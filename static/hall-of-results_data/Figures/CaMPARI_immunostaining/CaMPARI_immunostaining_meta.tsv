CaMPARI expression: Effects of fixation and use of immunostaining to recover converted neurons.<U+00A0>(A)<U+00A0>After fixation in 4% PFA, only a few neurons in S1 cortex show some weak red fluorescence signal reflecting the photoconversion of CaMPARI carried out<U+00A0>in vivo.<U+00A0>(A1)<U+00A0>A large number of unconverted green neurons are still visible.<U+00A0>(A2)<U+00A0>When the CaMPARI 4F6 antibody targeting the converted form of CaMPARI is used, it reveals converted neurons, and<U+00A0>(A3), distinguishes them from neighboring unconverted neurons as seen in the merged image. Bottom row, magnified views of inset regions showing converted vs. non-converted cells. Sections are coronal, 300 <U+00B5>m and were taken directly from an<U+00A0>in vitro<U+00A0>experiment and placed in PFA overnight. Blood vessels are prominent because the brain was not perfused prior to fixation. Scale bar in A 100 <U+00B5>m, in inset 50 <U+00B5>m."
