Episodic memories are modelled as random activation patterns with shared statistical regularities. If the environment is simple (left), the regularities can be extracted in both, the multisynaptic (blue line) and shortcut pathway (red lines), and neural replay (dashed line) enhances consolidation speed into the shortcut pathway compared to random reactivations (solid line). If the environment is too complex (right), the multisynaptic pathway cannot learn to generalize and neural replay is necessary for consolidation into the shortcut pathway."
