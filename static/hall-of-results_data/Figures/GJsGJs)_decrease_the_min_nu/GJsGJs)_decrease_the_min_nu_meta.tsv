(a) Example of spiking activity and network firing rate of a GJ-free network when only 56 neurons out of 200 receive excitation: oscillations are weak and unsteady. (b) Same as (a) but including GJs: oscillations are stronger and reliable. (c, d) Identical to (a, b) but for 80 excited interneurons, which is sufficient for the GJ-free network to reach the oscillation strength threshold. (e) Oscillation strength as a function of the number of excited neurons of the GJ network (solid line), and of the GJ-free network (dashed line, see Section 2.5 for details). GJs decrease the number of neurons that is required to reach a certain threshold (here 0.1) of the oscillation strength. Note that (e<U+0096>h) share their x-axes. (f) Network frequency, displayed for suprathreshold oscillation strengths (solid triangle for GJ network, dashed triangle for GJ-free network). (g) Synchrony index. (h) Firing rate. Plots in (e<U+0096>h) are smoothed by a Gaussian function with a width of 5 <U+0093>excited neurons.<U+0094> For an overview of the parameters see Tables 1 and 2"	"https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14267"	"Published"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"to_Fill"	"2019-05-16 16:28:02"	"Null"	"Null"
