 description = "Labeling of Active Neurons with CAMPARI. Procedure for transfection, conversion and imaging.<U+00A0>(A)<U+00A0>In this schematic, cultured neurons are treated with Cal-Light virus. After expression of the construct (indicated via red fluorescence), photostimulation is applied. Imaging then reveals neurons that were active while receiving the light stimulus (i.e., they co-express GFP and thus appear yellow in merged channels).<U+00A0>(B)<U+00A0>In this example, CaMPARI virus was injected into S1 cortex; expression of the construct is imaged using an epifluorescence microscope. A large number of neurons express CaMPARI 3 weeks after virus injection. Left, injection site imaged through the cranial window before and after 405 nm photoconversion. Note the reduction of green/red ratio immediately after photoconversion. Right, demonstration of photoconverted neurons in acute brain slices of S1 (parasagittal, 300 <U+00B5>m)."

 description = "Slow-wave rhythms characteristic of deep sleep can be found across various brain regions in vertebrates. Here, we discover compound delta oscillations in the sleep-regulating R5 network of Drosophila. We find that the power of these slow-wave oscillations increases with sleep need. Optical multi-unit voltage recordings reveal that single R5 neurons get synchronized by activating circadian input pathways. We show that this synchronization depends on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) coincidence detector function. Genetically targeting the coincidence detector function of NMDARs in R5, abolished network-specific compound slow-wave oscillations. It also disrupted sleep and facilitated light-induced wakening, establishing a role for slow-wave oscillations in regulating sleep and sensory gating. We therefore propose that the synchronization-based increase in oscillatory power likely represents an evolutionarily conserved, potentially “optimal,” strategy for constructing sleep-regulating sensory gates."

 description = "Learning of semantic generalizations from specific experiences. Episodic memories are modelled as random activation patterns with shared statistical regularities. If the environment is simple (left), the regularities can be extracted in both, the multisynaptic (blue line) and shortcut pathway (red lines), and neural replay (dashed line) enhances consolidation speed into the shortcut pathway compared to random reactivations (solid line). If the environment is too complex (right), the multisynaptic pathway cannot learn to generalize and neural replay is necessary for consolidation into the shortcut pathway."

After blocking inhibitory transmission in HVC with bilateral infusion of GABAA receptor antagonist, gabazine, call response latencies are significantly shorter (orange) and more likely to overlap with call playbacks than under control conditions (blue, from (a)). <br> d) Call related activity of HVC neurons. Example traces of four intracellular recordings from HVC neurons aligned to onset of call production. From top to bottom: the recorded traces were obtained from an interneuron (red), two different premotor neurons (green & blue), and a premotor neuron recorded after local application of gabazine (orange). Interneurons increased their firing rate prior to calls, while premotor neurons fired temporally precise bursts around call onset, but were silent when birds are not vocalizing."
