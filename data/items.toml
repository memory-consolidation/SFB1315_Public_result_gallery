Adult   brain,   10d (g)   +/atg9-RNAi   and   (h)   gh146/atg9-RNAi immunostained  for  BRPNc82.  Scale  bar:  50<U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707><U+0001D707>.  (i)  Quantification  of  BRPNc82  intensity within   the   central   brain   region   normalized   to   control   (n   =   6-11   independent   brains; nsp>0.5, Mann-Whitney U-test). In the box and whisker plots, the middle line of  a  box  represents  the  median (50th  percentile)  and  the  terminal  lines  of  a  box  represent  the  25th  and  75th  percentile.  The  whiskers  represent  the  lowest  and  the  highest value."
